I'm delighted to share my latest project with you, which has been particularly gratifying for me due to its unique challenges. This endeavor goes beyond traditional data analysis and visualization; it involves the creation of a sentiment prediction model for text. This project marks a pivotal step into the realm of Natural Language Processing (NLP).
Utilizing a pre-trained BERT model, I developed a sentiment prediction system for customer reviews. Following this, I meticulously undertook the data cleaning and visualization processes. Through these efforts, I successfully visualized the average sentiment of visitors to each area and hotel during each quarter of the year. This included insightful analyses of visitor counts to each hotel during specific quarters.
I hope that the visualizations I've created will prove valuable to the company's founders, enabling them to enhance targeted advertising for each area and improve the services provided by each hotel.
